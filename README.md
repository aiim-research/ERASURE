## üìò General Information

ERASURE offers fully extensible built-in components, allowing users to define custom unlearning techniques, integrate custom and synthetic datasets, implement tailored evaluation metrics, and meld seamlessly with state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Additionally, it provides a flexible environment for defining and running unlearning experiments, enabling researchers to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of various unlearning methods systematically.

The framework is inside the ```erasure``` folder. A JSON configuration file is everything ERASURE needs to run.

You can find examples of configurations in the ```config``` folder. Specifically, ```example.jsonc``` and ```proof_of_concept.jsonc``` are simple configurations designed as a starting point.

## üß≠ Guide

You can find a step-by-step guide on how to use ERASURE in our IJCAI demo paper: https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2025/1255

You may also find the presentation in the ```guide``` folder useful to implement your methods in the ERASURE framework. 



## üß™ Example Workflow

<div align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gcar8Zz.png" alt="worfklow" width="500"/>
</div>

To run an experiment, you just have to run:

```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py configs/example.jsonc
```

in your terminal, given that you have dependencies installed.

### üß© Built-in Unlearners 

Developing your own custom Unlearner in ERASURE is easy. 

However, benchmarking your Unlearner in an unified environment is just as important. Right now, ERASURE comes built-in with the following Unlearners:

## üìò General Information

<p align="justify">
ERASURE offers fully extensible built-in components, allowing users to define custom unlearning techniques, integrate custom and synthetic datasets, implement tailored evaluation metrics, and meld seamlessly with state-of-the-art machine learning models. Additionally, it provides a flexible environment for defining and running unlearning experiments, enabling researchers to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of various unlearning methods systematically.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The framework is inside the <code>erasure</code> folder. A JSON configuration file is everything ERASURE needs to run.
</p>

<p align="justify">
You can find examples of configurations in the <code>config</code> folder. Specifically, <code>example.jsonc</code> and <code>proof_of_concept.jsonc</code> are simple configurations designed as a starting point.
</p>

## üß≠ Guide

You can find a step-by-step guide on how to use ERASURE in our IJCAI demo paper: https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2025/1255

You may also find the presentation in the ```guide``` folder useful to implement your methods in the ERASURE framework. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiim-research/ERASURE.git
cd ERASURE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## üß™ Example Workflow

<div align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gcar8Zz.png" alt="worfklow" width="500"/>
</div>

To run an experiment, you just have to run:

```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py configs/example.jsonc
```

in your terminal, given that you have dependencies installed.

### üóÇÔ∏è Datasets

You can quickly implement any Dataset you like in ERASURE. At the moment, ERASURE has built-in DataSource classes for the following sources:

### üß© Built-in Unlearners 

Developing your own custom Unlearner in ERASURE is easy. 

However, benchmarking your Unlearner in an unified environment is just as important. Right now, ERASURE comes built-in with the following Unlearners:

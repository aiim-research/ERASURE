## General Information
The challenge of ensuring privacy and compliance in machine learning models, such as those used in recommendation systems, healthcare, and financial forecasting, is exacerbated by the difficulty of removing specific data from trained models. Machine Unlearning (MU) techniques aim to address this by providing methods to selectively erase data from models, enhancing privacy, trustworthiness, and adaptability. However, the current landscape of MU research is fragmented, with inconsistencies in definitions, methodologies, datasets, and evaluation protocols. 

To tackle these challenges, we introduce ERASURE, a research framework designed to facilitate the research process of machine unlearning, focusing on efficiently and securely removing specific data or knowledge from machine learning models. This framework addresses privacy and compliance concerns by providing a way to systematically evaluate algorithms and methodologies that allow for the selective "erasure" of data, ensuring that the information has no residual influence on model predictions once removed.

ERASURE offers fully extensible built-in components, allowing users to define custom unlearning techniques, integrate custom and synthetic datasets, implement tailored evaluation metrics, and meld seamlessly with state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Additionally, it provides a flexible environment for defining and running unlearning experiments, enabling researchers to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of various unlearning methods systematically.
